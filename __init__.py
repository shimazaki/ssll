    """
    Master-function of the State-Space Analysis of Spike Correlation package.
    Uses the expectation-maximisation algorithm to find the probability
    distributions of natural parameters of spike-train interactions over time.
    Calls slave functions to perform the expectation and maximisation steps
    repeatedly until the data likelihood reaches an asymptotic value.

    Note that the execution of some slave functions to this master function are
    of exponential complexity with respect to the `order' parameter.

    :param numpy.ndarray spikes:
        Binary matrix with dimensions (time, runs, cells), in which a `1' in
        location (t, r, c) denotes a spike at time t in run r by cell c.
    :param int order:
        Order of spike-train interactions to estimate, for example, 2 =
        pairwise, 3 = triplet-wise...
    :param int window:
        Bin-width for counting spikes, in milliseconds.
    :param string map_function:
        Name of the function to use for maximum a-posterior estimation of the
        natural parameters at each timestep. Refer to max_posterior.py.
    :param float lmdbda:
        Inverse coefficient on the identity matrix of the initial
        state-transition covariance matrix.
    :param int max_iter:
        Maximum number of iterations for which to run the EM algorithm.
    :param bool exact:
        Parameter weather exact likelihood or pseudo likelihood should be used

    :returns:
        Results encapsulated in a container.EMData object, containing the
        smoothed posterior probability distributions of the natural parameters
        of the spike-train interactions at each timestep, conditional upon the
        given spikes.
